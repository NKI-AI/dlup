Dlup offers a set of utilities to ease the process of running Deep Learning algorithms on
Whole Slide Images.


## Features
- Read whole-slide images at any arbitrary resolution by seamlessly interpolating between the pyramidal levels
- Dataset classes to handle whole-slide images in a tile-by-tile manner compatible with pytorch
- Annotation classes which can load GeoJSON, [V7 Darwin](https://www.v7labs.com/), [HALO](https://indicalab.com/halo/) and [ASAP](https://computationalpathologygroup.github.io/ASAP/) formats and read parts of it (e.g. a tile)
- Transforms to handle annotations per tile, resulting, together with the dataset classes a dataset consisting of tiles of whole-slide images with corresponding masks as targets, readily useable with a pytorch dataloader
- Command-line utilities to report on the metadata of WSIs, and convert masks to polygons

Check the [full documentation](https://docs.aiforoncology.nl/dlup) for more details on how to use dlup.

## Quickstart
The package can be installed using `python -m pip install dlup`.

## Used by
- [ahcore](https://github.com/NKI-AI/ahcore.git): a pytorch lightning based-library for computational pathology
