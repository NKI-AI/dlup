articles, and such.

The best way to send feedback is to file an `issue`_.

If you are proposing a feature:

Get Started!
############
Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `dlup` for local development.

1. Fork the `dlup` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/dlup.git

3. Create a virtual environment either through conda, docker or virtualenv

4. Install git pre-commit hooks

   - Install `pre-commit`_.
   - Install pre-commit hooks: :code:`pre-commit install`.

Now the pre-commit hooks will run before committing, but you can also run `pre-commit run --all` explicitly.

5. Install your local copy into a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd dlup/
    $ pip install --editable ".[dev]"

4. Create a branch for local development:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature`

Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests and the pre-commit hooks and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with pre-commit:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make tests
   $ tox
   $ pre-commit

To get pylint and tox, just pip install them.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature


7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
#######################
Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.8 and 3.9, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.com/NKI-AI/dlup/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
####
To run a subset of tests:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pytest tests.test_dlup`

Deploying
#########
A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed. Then run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
    $ python .dev/bump_date.py
    $ git push
